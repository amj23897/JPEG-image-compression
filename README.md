# JPEG-image-compression
### Objective:
To implement JPEG image compression algorithm in C language

### Methodology:
Image compression is done using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Quantization Matrix. The compressed image is then reconstructed using Inverse DCT. Furthermore, Double Compression of JPEG images was done using DCT with estimated quality factor.
